# Installation

Just download the [ZIP](https://github.com/hmlendea/stellaris-universum-infinitum/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents into your "mod" directory.

**Note:** This mod is OS-agnostic, which means it will work on all operating systems supported by Stellaris (Windows, Linux and Mac)

**UPDATING THE MOD:**
- Instead on making versioned releases, I decided to make a single "rolling release", so check regularly for changes (the date especially).
You can see the changes in the changelog.
- It's also always recommended to delete the old files when updating.
