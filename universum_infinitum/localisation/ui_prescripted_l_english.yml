 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ui_starcraft_terran_dominion:0 "The Terran Dominion, otherwise known as the Dominion of Man, is a human realm far away from it's original homeworld, Earth. Three colony ships fron Earth were lost in space after system malfunctions, and eventually landed on habitable planets. Different factions thrived there and warred each other, until the Sons of Korhal rebellion achieved victory and declared the formation of the Terran Dominion, on the ashes of the other, mostly of the Terran Confederacy."
